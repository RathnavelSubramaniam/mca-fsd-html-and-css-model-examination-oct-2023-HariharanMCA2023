        <p>Beginning as early as the 14th century, a grocer (or "purveyor") was a dealer in comestible dry goods such as spices, peppers, sugar, and (later) cocoa, tea, and coffee. Because these items were often bought in bulk, they were named after the French word for wholesaler, or "grossier". This, in turn, is derived from the Medieval Latin term "grossarius",[8] from which the term "gross" (meaning a quantity of 12 dozen, or 144) is also derived..</p>
        <p>Definition:</p>
        <p>As increasing numbers of staple food-stuffs became available in cans and other less-perishable packaging, the trade expanded its province. Today, grocers deal in a wide range of staple food-stuffs including such perishables as dairy products, meats, and produce. Such goods are, hence, called groceries..</p>

    <h1 class="center" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 30%;">Super Market:</h1>
    <img src="./images/email.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-left: 30%;">
    <p class="para" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">Stores offering a full line of groceries, meat, and produce with at least 2 million USD in annual sales and up to 15% of their sales in general merchandise (GM) and health & beauty care (HBC). These stores typically carry anywhere from 15,000 to 60,000 SKUs (depending on the size of the store) and may offer a service deli, a service bakery, and/or a pharmacy.
        Different from traditional supermarkets and traditional natural food stores, fresh stores emphasize perishables and offer center-store assortments that differ from those of traditional retailersâ€”especially in the areas of ethnic, natural, and organic, e.g., Whole Foods, The Fresh Market, and some independents.</p>
